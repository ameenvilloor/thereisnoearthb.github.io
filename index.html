For mountains, hills and forests, where waste management is challenged with higher costs, special provisions must be made to overcome this through levy of cess/ surcharge to finance better collection and management. We also recommend a viability gap funding provision to be made for waste entrepreneurs (as PROs) for the mountain states.</li> <li>The models that form the main component of the EPR are complex and hard to comprehend and need to be explained in greater detail. We recommend that a thorough consultation with key stakeholders on the provisions of the models be made before they are finalised.</li> <li>The framework deems all plastics to be same, but low value non recyclable plastics mainly MLPs, styrofoam, PVC and other non recyclable plastic that do not flow back into the recycling stream must be looked at separately and companies must be strongly disincentivized for their continued production.</li> <li>The plastic credits system advances pay and pollute and gives companies free rein to keep producing single use plastics, while offsetting the pollution caused by buying credits. This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision. We recommend that this plastic credit system is set around geographical parameters with recovery of plastic waste from mountain states to be given special preference by the PIBOs.</li> <li>This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision.

A key reason why so much plastic ends up in the trash is because nearly 50% plastic is being made into single-use items (Plastics Oceans International) and no amount of management and recycling will solve the issue unless <strong>production systems are made responsible and sustainable</strong> which should be the main vision of extended producer responsibility.</p> <p>The Prime Minister urged people to make India a plastic-free (especially single use plastic - SUP) nation during his Independence day speech of August 15, 2019 and the same was declared at the UN General Assembly 2019.

For mountains, hills and forests, where waste management is challenged with higher costs, special provisions must be made to overcome this through levy of cess/ surcharge to finance better collection and management. We also recommend a viability gap funding provision to be made for waste entrepreneurs (as PROs) for the mountain states.</li> <li>The models that form the main component of the EPR are complex and hard to comprehend and need to be explained in greater detail. We recommend that a thorough consultation with key stakeholders on the provisions of the models be made before they are finalised.</li> <li>The framework deems all plastics to be same, but low value non recyclable plastics mainly MLPs, styrofoam, PVC and other non recyclable plastic that do not flow back into the recycling stream must be looked at separately and companies must be strongly disincentivized for their continued production.</li> <li>The plastic credits system advances pay and pollute and gives companies free rein to keep producing single use plastics, while offsetting the pollution caused by buying credits. This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision. We recommend that this plastic credit system is set around geographical parameters with recovery of plastic waste from mountain states to be given special preference by the PIBOs.</li> <li>This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision.

For mountains, hills and forests, where waste management is challenged with higher costs, special provisions must be made to overcome this through levy of cess/ surcharge to finance better collection and management. We also recommend a viability gap funding provision to be made for waste entrepreneurs (as PROs) for the mountain states.</li> <li>The models that form the main component of the EPR are complex and hard to comprehend and need to be explained in greater detail. We recommend that a thorough consultation with key stakeholders on the provisions of the models be made before they are finalised.</li> <li>The framework deems all plastics to be same, but low value non recyclable plastics mainly MLPs, styrofoam, PVC and other non recyclable plastic that do not flow back into the recycling stream must be looked at separately and companies must be strongly disincentivized for their continued production.</li> <li>The plastic credits system advances pay and pollute and gives companies free rein to keep producing single use plastics, while offsetting the pollution caused by buying credits. This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision. We recommend that this plastic credit system is set around geographical parameters with recovery of plastic waste from mountain states to be given special preference by the PIBOs.</li> <li>This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision.

A key reason why so much plastic ends up in the trash is because nearly 50% plastic is being made into single-use items (Plastics Oceans International) and no amount of management and recycling will solve the issue unless <strong>production systems are made responsible and sustainable</strong> which should be the main vision of extended producer responsibility.</p> <p>The Prime Minister urged people to make India a plastic-free (especially single use plastic - SUP) nation during his Independence day speech of August 15, 2019 and the same was declared at the UN General Assembly 2019.

For mountains, hills and forests, where waste management is challenged with higher costs, special provisions must be made to overcome this through levy of cess/ surcharge to finance better collection and management. We also recommend a viability gap funding provision to be made for waste entrepreneurs (as PROs) for the mountain states.</li> <li>The models that form the main component of the EPR are complex and hard to comprehend and need to be explained in greater detail. We recommend that a thorough consultation with key stakeholders on the provisions of the models be made before they are finalised.</li> <li>The framework deems all plastics to be same, but low value non recyclable plastics mainly MLPs, styrofoam, PVC and other non recyclable plastic that do not flow back into the recycling stream must be looked at separately and companies must be strongly disincentivized for their continued production.</li> <li>The plastic credits system advances pay and pollute and gives companies free rein to keep producing single use plastics, while offsetting the pollution caused by buying credits. This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision. We recommend that this plastic credit system is set around geographical parameters with recovery of plastic waste from mountain states to be given special preference by the PIBOs.</li> <li>This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision.

For mountains, hills and forests, where waste management is challenged with higher costs, special provisions must be made to overcome this through levy of cess/ surcharge to finance better collection and management. We also recommend a viability gap funding provision to be made for waste entrepreneurs (as PROs) for the mountain states.</li> <li>The models that form the main component of the EPR are complex and hard to comprehend and need to be explained in greater detail.

This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision.

For mountains, hills and forests, where waste management is challenged with higher costs, special provisions must be made to overcome this through levy of cess/ surcharge to finance better collection and management. We also recommend a viability gap funding provision to be made for waste entrepreneurs (as PROs) for the mountain states.</li> <li>The models that form the main component of the EPR are complex and hard to comprehend and need to be explained in greater detail.

A key reason why so much plastic ends up in the trash is because nearly 50% plastic is being made into single-use items (Plastics Oceans International) and no amount of management and recycling will solve the issue unless <strong>production systems are made responsible and sustainable</strong> which should be the main vision of extended producer responsibility.</p> <p>The Prime Minister urged people to make India a plastic-free (especially single use plastic - SUP) nation during his Independence day speech of August 15, 2019 and the same was declared at the UN General Assembly 2019.

For mountains, hills and forests, where waste management is challenged with higher costs, special provisions must be made to overcome this through levy of cess/ surcharge to finance better collection and management. We also recommend a viability gap funding provision to be made for waste entrepreneurs (as PROs) for the mountain states.</li> <li>The models that form the main component of the EPR are complex and hard to comprehend and need to be explained in greater detail. We recommend that a thorough consultation with key stakeholders on the provisions of the models be made before they are finalised.</li> <li>The framework deems all plastics to be same, but low value non recyclable plastics mainly MLPs, styrofoam, PVC and other non recyclable plastic that do not flow back into the recycling stream must be looked at separately and companies must be strongly disincentivized for their continued production.</li> <li>The plastic credits system advances pay and pollute and gives companies free rein to keep producing single use plastics, while offsetting the pollution caused by buying credits. This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision. We recommend that this plastic credit system is set around geographical parameters with recovery of plastic waste from mountain states to be given special preference by the PIBOs.</li> <li>This model enables paper trading and companies taking real responsibility and mountains, hills and forests stand to lose out greatly under this provision.
