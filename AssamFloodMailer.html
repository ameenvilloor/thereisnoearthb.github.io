Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas.

The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas.

The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan.

Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India.

Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall.

The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas. A lack of inter-state as well as international coordination between countries traversed by the Brahmaputra poses the prime challenge to tackling this issue.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Anthropogenic Climate Change</strong></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rise in average global temperatures</strong> have led to a worrying trend of <strong>no rain for long periods and then a sudden bout of excessive rainfall, causing extreme weather events. </strong></p><p>Earlier this year the <strong>Ministry of Earth Sciences</strong> (MoES) in their climate report titled <strong>Assessment of Climate Change Over The Indian Region</strong> reported that <strong>increased frequency of localised heavy rainfall</strong> on sub-daily and daily timescales <strong>has enhanced flood risk over India</strong>.

The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas.

Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area.

Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan.

The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas.

The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas. A lack of inter-state as well as international coordination between countries traversed by the Brahmaputra poses the prime challenge to tackling this issue.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Anthropogenic Climate Change</strong></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rise in average global temperatures</strong> have led to a worrying trend of <strong>no rain for long periods and then a sudden bout of excessive rainfall, causing extreme weather events. </strong></p><p>Earlier this year the <strong>Ministry of Earth Sciences</strong> (MoES) in their climate report titled <strong>Assessment of Climate Change Over The Indian Region</strong> reported that <strong>increased frequency of localised heavy rainfall</strong> on sub-daily and daily timescales <strong>has enhanced flood risk over India</strong>.

The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas. A lack of inter-state as well as international coordination between countries traversed by the Brahmaputra poses the prime challenge to tackling this issue.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Anthropogenic Climate Change</strong></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rise in average global temperatures</strong> have led to a worrying trend of <strong>no rain for long periods and then a sudden bout of excessive rainfall, causing extreme weather events. </strong></p><p>Earlier this year the <strong>Ministry of Earth Sciences</strong> (MoES) in their climate report titled <strong>Assessment of Climate Change Over The Indian Region</strong> reported that <strong>increased frequency of localised heavy rainfall</strong> on sub-daily and daily timescales <strong>has enhanced flood risk over India</strong>.

The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas. A lack of inter-state as well as international coordination between countries traversed by the Brahmaputra poses the prime challenge to tackling this issue.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Anthropogenic Climate Change</strong></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rise in average global temperatures</strong> have led to a worrying trend of <strong>no rain for long periods and then a sudden bout of excessive rainfall, causing extreme weather events. </strong></p><p>Earlier this year the <strong>Ministry of Earth Sciences</strong> (MoES) in their climate report titled <strong>Assessment of Climate Change Over The Indian Region</strong> reported that <strong>increased frequency of localised heavy rainfall</strong> on sub-daily and daily timescales <strong>has enhanced flood risk over India</strong>.

'mailto:replace@correctemail.com?bcc=thereisnoearthb@gmail.com&subject=Assam Floods: Urgent plea to save Assam&body=<h1>Urgent Attention required</h1><p>This is in light of the <strong>recent Assam floods which (at the time of writing) have claimed 87 human and 100 animal lives and affected over 24 lakh people in 24 districts.  </strong></p><p>I write this letter <strong>on behalf of the tens of thousands affected every year in order to draw your attention to their recurrent plight of over 50 years.  </strong></p><p>Floods are as natural in the floodplain ecosystem of Assam as snowfall in the upper Himalayan states, in fact Assam has been feeding and thriving off of them for centuries now. However the conversion of these floods into a crisis and the resultant devastation is a largely human affair. Although various natural factors like the earthquake of August 1950 which left the Brahmaputra more unstable are responsible for the increased extremity of the floods, they are neither important nor relevant to abating this crisis. The prime and most important reason behind this catastrophe has been the misplaced notion of development that presents nature as a wild beast to be tamed and floods as a natural calamity to be avoided and curbed at all costs has been catastrophic . But natural floods are not a calamity, our transgressions against nature are.  </p><p>And facing and solving this calamity requires accepting and understanding it.  </p><p>To that end,the first part of <strong>this letter</strong><strong>describes the various human factors that have intensified flood-induced devastation in the state of Assam</strong> and continue to do so. The next part <strong>provides guidelines and suggests solutions based on expert-advice</strong> on effectively solving these problems.</p><p>The letter <strong>concludes with immediate demands that will serve as a good starting point</strong> for dealing with this human-made flooding crisis in the long-term.  </p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong><em>HUMAN-INDUCED/CAUSED PROBLEMS and INTENSIFIERS</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Embankments</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Introduced in Assam back in the 1950s as a temporary flood management solution, most of them have now outlived their utility and frequently breach, worsening the floods. Embankments have been considered a poor flood management strategy as they restrict the flow of the river, subsequently increasing its intensity and pressure. The floods caused due to breaches are much more devastating than those that occur naturally.</p><p>Moreover, while embankments prevent flooding in the areas they are built around (as long as they do not breach) the same embankments channel the floodwater in greater volume and intensity towards other areas not protected by any embankments.  </p><p>Hence the total dependence of Assam upon a single solution that was supposed to be temporary and is claimed to be unsound by multiple experts has led to more harm than good.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Deforestation</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Simply put, deforestation leads to more soil erosion and easier invasion of water in settlements as tree roots hold the top-soil together preventing soil and water run-off. Forests also absorb large amounts of rainfall thereby reducing the volume of water in rivers. Rathin Barman, deputy director of Wildlife Trust of India posted in Assam says >>As we are cutting trees on the catchment areas, silts flowing down the hills are raising beds of our rivers.<< Rising river beds lead to overflowing of rivers which worsens floods.  </p><p>A 2018 study by researchers from the Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun, examined the pace of deforestation in the elephant landscape of the Northeast, covering 42,000 square kilometers in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The study said that: With the highest rate of deforestation (in the Assam-Arunachal area) in India, the study area can also be addressed as the deforestation hotspot of India. Although the State of our Forests report by MoEFCC for 2019 reports that there has not been a decrease in forest cover in Assam compared to 2017, there have been questions raised about the verifiability of its data.</p><p>The 2018 study had also identified increasing human population and subsequent demand on land for cultivation as major reasons for forest cover depletion. Significantly, the loss of land from erosion of river-banks and deforestation form a vicious cycle as the former pushes encroachment of forest land and deforestation which in turn increases soil erosion creating demand for more land. Thus even as the state government has of late been taking some steps for afforestation, undoing of the long-standing deforestation issue will require more permanent and holistic solutions to the larger issues.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Destruction of Wetlands</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Assam has almost 3,500 wetlands that are like natural safety valves against floods because of their water-holding capacity. Wetlands, locally known as beels, act as reservoirs and rejuvenating them before monsoon can help in mitigating flood in parts of the state, said Dulal Chandra Goswami, former head of department of environmental science at Guwahati University. However, most of them are as good as dead now with very little capacity owing to encroachment and construction activities.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Human encroachment</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Human encroachment does not only lead to greater deforestation but also directly threatens already vulnerable populations.  </p><p>Traditionally local peasants in Assam settled and farmed in the floodplains away from the riverbed, using the latter for seasonal cultivation instead. This strategy had allowed for a more peaceful coexistence with the floods However with the advent of the British, commercial farming was begun on these low-lying lands and human settlement started moving closer to the riverbed. As the population grew, so did the demand for land and the further occupation of areas closer to the river-beds which made human settlements more prone to intense flooding.</p><p>Further, as villages continue to get eroded due to intense floods, many who cannot afford to move to other locations are left with the only option of living on the side of embankments in very poor living conditions. This increases their vulnerability as these areas are highly prone to flooding, especially from embankment failures as mentioned above.</p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Poor Urban Planning and Construction</strong></strong></li></ul><p>Poor urban planning often results in the destruction of natural drainage and wetlands that act as a reservoir of the water in the event of rainfall. Firstly, the concrete ground is non-porous and does not allow the water to percolate and recharge the groundwater aquifers.</p><p>In Indian cities, the storm-water drainage is not properly prepared for the monsoon rains. Secondly, in many cases, the water bodies are turned into landfills and encroached upon for construction.</p><p>Moreover we also have the construction of highways such as NH-37 which cuts across the Kaziranga National Park and is extremely dangerous for the animals from the National Park who cross it to reach the highlands of Karbi Anglong Hills in order to secure themselves from the floods which of lately have been inundating too much of the Park area. Mushrooming of hotels, restaurants, shops, and ancillary structures of the tea industry has further worsened the situation.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Hydropower projects</strong></strong></li></ul><p>The floods in Assam are also gravely worsened by the release of water from Dams in neighbouring Indian states like Arunachal Pradesh as well as neighbouring countries like Bhutan. These releases often come without a warning and coincide with the monsoon season inundating large areas. A lack of inter-state as well as international coordination between countries traversed by the Brahmaputra poses the prime challenge to tackling this issue.  </p><p><br /><br /><br /></p><ul><li><strong><strong>Anthropogenic Climate Change</strong></strong></li></ul><p><strong>Rise in average global temperatures</strong> have led to a worrying trend of <strong>no rain for long periods and then a sudden bout of excessive rainfall, causing extreme weather events. </strong></p><p>Earlier this year the <strong>Ministry of Earth Sciences</strong> (MoES) in their climate report titled <strong>Assessment of Climate Change Over The Indian Region</strong> reported that <strong>increased frequency of localised heavy rainfall</strong> on sub-daily and daily timescales <strong>has enhanced flood risk over India</strong>.
