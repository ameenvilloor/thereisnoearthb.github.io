These are practices of animal cruelty. In a country where dogs are traded as domestic pets, used in the Police Department, used as therapy animals, etc, our nation must reconsider the brutal plight we exhibit on the canines. </p><p>The <strong>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 </strong>and <strong>Wildlife (Protection) Act</strong>, make provisions which protect stray dogs against cruelty and <strong>Stray Dog Management Rules, 2001</strong> makes it <strong>illegal to remove or relocate dogs</strong> from their territory.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCDYxgtnDIP/">https://www.instagram.com/p/CCDYxgtnDIP/</a><a href="https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-nagaland-s-death-pits-for-dogs-beaten-to-death-meat-339429">https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-nagaland-s-death-pits-for-dogs-beaten-to-death-meat-339429</a> and <a href="https://easternmirrornagaland.com/maneka-gandhi-targets-dog-meat-sale/">https://easternmirrornagaland.com/maneka-gandhi-targets-dog-meat-sale/</a> both these things are happening in Dimapur.</p><p><strong>Under section 429 indian penal code whoever commits mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animal must be held accountable.</strong></p><p>I write to you as an animal lover a compassionate human being and urge you to look into the matter. </p><p>Because stray dogs are living creatures, as well as wildlife, they come within the purview of Article 51A(g). And from the discussions above, it is clear that the rights of stray dogs include the following:</p><p>(i) Right to be protected</p><p>(ii) Right to be shown compassion, is constitutionally guaranteed</p><p>(iii) Right to be free from all forms of cruelty</p><p>Sincerely </p><p>An animal Lover and Compassionate Citizen</p>';">
