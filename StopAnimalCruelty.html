In a country where dogs are treated as domestic pets, used in the Police Departments and as therapy animals etc, our nation must reconsider the brutal plight we inflict upon the canines.</p><p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3688190/Dog-meat-death-pits-unveiled-Kohima-Nagaland-India-shocking-footage.html</p><p>I am writing to you as an animal lover and a compassionate human being to urge you to look into the matter.</p><p><strong>From a Legal Standpoint</strong></p><p>The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, make provisions which protect stray dogs against cruelty and Stray Dog Management Rules, 2001 make it illegal to remove or relocate dogs from their territory.</p><p>According to https://www.instagram.com/p/CCDYxgtnDIP/ and https://easternmirrornagaland.com/maneka-gandhi-targets-dog-meat-sale/ both these things are happening in Dimapur.</p><p>Under section 429 read with section 2 of Indian Penal Code whoever commits mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animal must be held accountable.</p><p>Because stray dogs are living creatures, as well as wildlife, they come within the purview of Article 51A(g). And from the discussions above, it is clear that the rights of stray dogs include the following:</p><p>(i) Right to be protected</p><p>(ii) Right to be shown compassion, is constitutionally guaranteed</p><p>(iii) Right to be free from all forms of cruelty</p><p>Sources: https://www.lawnn.com/stray-dogs/</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCDYxgtnDIP/</p><p>https://easternmirrornagaland.com/maneka-gandhi-targets-dog-meat-sale/</p><p><strong>From the Standpoint of Animal Cruelty</strong></p><ol><li>With the rise of animal rights activism in the world where compassionate human beings are giving up speciesism, and are recognising the plight of thousands of sentient earthlings who are killed mercilessly to satisfy our taste palate. As the vegan movement is gaining momentum for talking openly about the cruelty inflicted on animals in factory farms which are effectively hidden from the eyes of their end consumers, a number of people are giving up the consumption of socially sanctioned meat like chicken, pork, beef, lamb, etc.</li><li>An argument in support of dog meat consumption states that it is hypocritical to ban meat consumption of one animal, just because it is one of the most petted animals in the world, while people go on consuming the meat of other equally intelligent animals like pigs and cows. I see the paradox here and hence, say, that while vegans all over the world are fighting to free these socially normalised food animals raised in inhumane environments for their meat, it is important to not let people add another animal on the list. This will not only normalise the suffering of these beings who feel pain as well, but also make the battle of establishing animal rights more difficult.</li></ol><p>https://youtu.be/yqSmYCBQths (1:39 minutes- Can you watch the video without gagging or feeling a pit in your stomach due to the disgust that this imagery creates?)</p><p>https://youtu.be/WaVPaC51O7w (1:37 minutes- To see the inhumane conditions in which dogs are kept in, with their bodies tightly strapped in a sack and their mouth closed shut with a string.)</p><p><strong>From a Public Health Standpoint</strong></p><ol><li>As opposed to the common conception about dog meat being iron rich, helping to keep one warm in winters and having high protein, consumption of dog meat can have direct and serious impact on the health of the people and development of terminal diseases. Consumption of unsanitized dog flesh and organs has caused rabies, trichinosis, cholera and hypervitaminosis A. As the sale of dog meat is not regularised by national authorities and is generally made available by catching street dogs that are exposed to a number of contaminants, it cannot be assured that the meat being sold is hygienic and safe to eat.</li><li>Along with this, another common way in which dog meat is sourced, is by poisoning pet dogs which upon entering the bloodstream of a human can have fatal effects.</li><li>The question to ask oneself is, do we want another COVID 19 like outbreak in the world because we cannot keep ourselves from eating anything that lives? In case you think that this practice has been around for decades, hence, nothing will happen, I urge you to think about how and when the swine flu, mad cow disease, Ebola virus, HIV, SARS and even COVID 19 emerged.</li><li>The state of Nagaland under 371A shall make any law - to that extent to safeguard the customary practices but if these social, religious practices are amounting to animal cruelty then it must stop even if such ban on this practice amounts to prejudice to the belief of the people of Nagaland.</li></ol><p>https://english.cambodiadaily.com/news/fifth-person-dies-after-eating-poisoned-dog-102466/ (Reports on human death after eating dog meat)</p><p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7961739/Millions-rabies-infected-dogs-slaughtered-meat-drowning-pits-Cambodia.html (Cambodia and the rabies crisis)</p><p>https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/may/17/amid-covid-pandemic-centre-urged-to-stop-trade-of-dog-cat-meat-2144555.html (Risks of eating dog meat)</p><p>We hereby humbly present our objections and concerns against the illegal, underground trade of stray dogs in Dimapur and other districts of Nagaland, where the dog meat is the part of Naga cuisine for many years, but now it has to be stopped. The kind of despicable, abusive and inhumane behavior the dogs are subjected to must come to an end.</p><p>Sincerely</p><p>An animal Lover and Compassionate Citizen</p>';">
