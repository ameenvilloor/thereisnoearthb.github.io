On June 19, 2020, Mr. Tripathi was murdered in Unnao district, Uttar Pradesh, allegedly for exposing the land-mafia and land grabbers. What is even more shocking than the crime, however, is the utter ignorance and lackadaisical attitude shown by the Uttar Pradesh State administration in providing security to the journalist who had written to the authorities and informed the police about the threat to his life on June 15 itself. The State has been unable to protect whistle-blowers like Shubham which time and again brings us to the question of safety and security of those who speak against the failures of the system.</p><p>While the brutal murder of Mr. Tripathi is a matter of grave concern for all those who are working to save the environment, it is most deeply disturbing for the journalists, who are tirelessly working to uncover environmental violations throughout the country, because this is not an event in isolation. While serving as the backbone of the environmental movement in the country by uncovering dangerous and important truths about environmental transgressions, these agents of truth are frequently harassed, threatened and even murdered by those against whom they speak. </p><p>Back in 2017, Chennai based journalist Sandhya Ravishankar faced many similar threats and harassment for her expose on the sand mafia and against S. Vaikundarajan, one of the largest beach sand-miner in the country. She was also trolled and accused of being a fake journalist, while Vaikundarajan, the suspect, has still not been arrested in spite of 150 to 200 criminal cases against him. </p><p>Further, in July 2018, two News-18 Punjabi journalists were attacked as they were investigating illegal mining in the town of Jalalabad. While in March 2018 journalist Sandeep Sharma was allegedly murdered in Bhind, Madhya Pradesh, even though prior to his death Sharma had asked for police protection, saying his life was in danger after conducting a sting operation on Sub Divisional Police Officer Indra Veer Singh Bhadouria in 2017.</p><p>All of these cases expose the deliberate delay in granting protection to said whistle-blowers owing to the nexus between corrupt officials and accused individuals. </p><p>Hence it is no surprising that the Press Freedom Index by the organization Reporters Without Borders ranked India at a dismal 142 out of 180 in its 2020 rankings. </p><p>There is clearly an urgent need for strong whistle-blower protection mechanisms and amendments in legal provisions for ensuring stricter and harsher punishments so that these brave stewards of our environment and democracy are protected. </p><p>The foresighted framers of our constitution considered freedom of the press as an essential part of the freedom of speech and expression as guaranteed in Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution. Hence we believe that it is the duty of the State to ensure that members of the Press, being the fourth pillar of our Democracy, are given ample and adequate protection. Ignorance, delay in response and inaction for the journalists who are threatened with death should not become the norm of the country as this will raise serious questions on the credibility of the people in uniform and further increase the growing lack of trust upon them by the public at large.</p><p>Hence to this end we make the following demands:</p><ul><li>An independent enquiry into the murder of Shubham Mani Tripathi and the most stringent of punishments to the guilty,</li><li>Immediate and effective operationalization of the Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2014, without any of the amendments proposed under the Whistle Blowers Protection (Amendment) Act, 2015, as they are completely dilutionary and contradictory to objective of the Act,</li><li>Drafting of a separate legislation for providing effective and proactive safeguards to Journalists and Activists threatened due to whistle-blowing activities,</li><li>Setting up of an independent committee under the aforementioned legislation to look into matters of threats and false cases against journalists. </li></ul><p><br /><br /></p><p>Hopeful of speedy and thorough action, </p><p>A concerned and vigilant citizen</p>';">
