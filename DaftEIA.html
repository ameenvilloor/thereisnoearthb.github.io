<p>&ldquo;<strong><em>The Environmental Impact Notification (EIA) draft 2020</em></strong>&rdquo;<br /> The new draft of EIA notification condemns everything that it is supposed to represent and dilutes existing Environmental Impact Assessment regulations that help protect and safeguard our environment.&nbsp;<br /><br /> The new draft EIA notification proposes to legitimize many current violations through post-facto approvals which mean giving environmental clearances after a potentially destructive project has already begun without any such clearance.&nbsp;<br /><br /> It also paralyzes the citizens by giving them limited to NO time for preparing for &amp; participating in public hearings about projects affecting them, thus weakening the public consultation process.&nbsp;<br /><br /> It also paralyzes the public consultation process by reducing the time available with stakeholders for preparing for &amp; participating in public hearings about projects that affect them, grossly weakening democratic public participation.&nbsp;<br /><br /> It also reduces the compliance requirements on the part of the project proponents requiring the promoter to submit a compliance report only once every year instead of the earlier requirement of twice a year and requiring the project proponents to file documents on which the environmental impact is to be assessed by themselves, thus leaving room for them to choose which data &amp; information to supply.<br /><br /> The new draft also increases the number of projects or activities which do not require an EIA process to be conducted at all.&nbsp;<br /><br /> And this isn't all. As a whole, the new draft EIA notification leaves us with a trail of failures to stress upon and opens up more avenues to "develop"at the cost of the very source of that development.&nbsp;<br /> We need to raise our voices to <strong>say a resounding NO to this mockery of environmental safeguards</strong> or history will remember us as the offenders whose silence enabled more crimes against nature.&nbsp;<br /></p>
