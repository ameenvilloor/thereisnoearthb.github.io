<p>&ldquo;<strong><em>The Environmental Impact Notification (EIA) draft 2020</em></strong>&rdquo;</p>
<p><br />The new draft EIA notification (2020) condemns everything that it is supposed to represent and dilutes existing environmental regulations that help protect and safeguard our environment. <br /><br /><br />The new draft EIA notification proposes to: <br />&bull; legitimise violations by those who start projects without environment clearance,<br />&bull; weaken the democratic public consultation process,<br />&bull; reduce the compliance requirements on the part of project proponents/promoters , <br />&bull; increase the number of projects that do not require an EIA process at all, <br />&bull; and much, much more <br />Thus opening up new escape routes for environmental violators &amp; enabling "development" at the cost of the very source of our lives. <br /><br />The coronavirus pandemic has shown us the disastrous consequences of encroaching upon nature and at the same time given us a window of opportunity to atone for our sins. But the draft EIA notification 2020 seeks to do its exact opposite &amp; repeat the same mistakes that led to this global crisis in the first place. <br />Thus we need to raise our voices &amp; say a resounding NO to this mockery of environmental law or else history will remember us as silent enablers of the horrifying 'crimes against nature' that will follow. <br />Let&rsquo;s save ourselves some dignity and NOT partake in this conspiracy against mother EARTH.</p>
