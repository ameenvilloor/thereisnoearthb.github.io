This decision is not only harmful for the forest but can also turn disastrous for the river water too. The villages chosen by the government are almost on the banks of the Sutlej River and industrial units near to it will impact Punjab and adjoining states very badly.</p> <p>Mattwara forest is one of the major forest reserves of Punjab and it must be protected at all costs, Mattewara forest is home to several species of antelopes, deer, and birds. Industrial Pollution will affect the ecological balance and in a result will destabilize the natural habitat of the forest. Punjab has the least forest cover with just 3.52 per cent forest cover (https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/forests/punjab-haryana-among-the-states-with-least-forest-cover-the-problem-runs-deep-59521) and the state is already suffering from severe environmental degradation and pollution which is resulting in a fatal atmosphere for so many young children and elderly citizens of Punjab. This decision must be reversed and the land should not be allotted for an industrial park on any other land available in Punjab.</p><p>We request you to kindly look into the matter and save what is left for our future generations to survive</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Yours Sincerely</p><p>A citizen of India</p>';">
