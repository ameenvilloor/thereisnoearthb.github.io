Their proximity to the river and the forest area brings with it <strong><em>biodiversity </em></strong>and therefore they <strong>are just as ecologically important as the forest</strong>.

Today Punjab already has the <strong>least forest cover </strong>(https://fsi.nic.in/isfr19/vol2/isfr-2019-vol-ii-punjab.pdf ) with just <strong><em>3.52 per cent of the total land </em></strong>(https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/forests/punjab-haryana-among-the-states-with-le ast-forest-cover-the-problem-runs-deep-59521) , furthermore only 0.02 percent of Very Dense Forest cover remains in Punjab today (https://fsi.nic.in/isfr19/vol2/isfr-2019-vol-ii-punjab.pdf) and the state is already suffering from <em>severe environmental degradation </em><em>and pollution </em>(of water, air and land) which is resulting in a fatal atmosphere for so many of its young children and elderly citizens. <em>This decision must be reversed </em>and no land should be allotted for an industrial park when Punjab is already in dire need of more forest cover and reduction in environmental polluters.
