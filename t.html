<body onload="javascript: window.location.href='mailto:mefcc@gov.in,eia2020-moefcc@gov.in,connect@mygov.nic.in,secy-moef@nic.in?bcc=thereisnoearthb@gmail.com&subject=Please Withdraw Draft EIA 2020&body=<div>I am aware that in March 2020, the ministry proposed a draft notification to replace the 2006 document. Currently, the notification is at the stage of public comments. I understand that the new notification is being brought in order to make the process more transparent and expedient.<br /><br />However, I, as a citizen and a participant of Swachh Bharat Abhiyaan, have concerns over it.</div><div>1. The new notification includes certain provisions which could end up diluting the EIA process, especially the <strong>public consultation aspect.</strong> It provides for a <strong>reduction of time period from 30 days to 20 days for the public to submit their responses during a public hearing for any application seeking environmental clearance</strong>. <strong>It also requires that the public hearing process be completed in 40 days compared to 45 days under the 2006 notification</strong>. The main reason stated for reducing the time is that it would become easy for new investments to complete the formality of EIA.<br /><br />- The danger is that if adequate time is not given for the preparation of views, comments and suggestions to those who would be affected by the project, then such public hearings would not be meaningful. </div><div>- In the Samarth Trust Case, the Delhi high court had considered EIAs a part of participatory justice in which the voice is given to the voiceless and it is like a jan sunwai, where the community is the jury.</div><div>- Unless a public hearing is meaningful, the whole EIA process would lack transparency and credibility. <strong>The reduction of time would particularly pose a problem in those areas where information is not easily accessible or areas in which people are not that well aware of the process itself. </strong>As the Supreme Court has said in several judgments over the years, the time for making any representation should be adequate and if it is not, then it would be a violation of the principles of natural justice.<br />- Even though the notification provides for the dissemination of information relating to public hearings through newspapers (and where dissemination through newspapers is not possible then by beating of drums or through radio or TV), the problem still remains. <strong>The issue of concern here is not the notice for public hearing but the access to information on which the affected people need to comment.</strong><br /><br />2. <strong>The project is allowed to start first and get an EIA clearance later.</strong> This will allow for unmonitored destruction of the environment and will pose a huge threat to the residing communities.</div><div>3. <strong>Loosened regulations: </strong>Rather than twice a year, the industries will have to now report compliance only once a year. Industries will be allowed to prepare reports themselves. There are high chances for them taking any and all measures in the name of development that will destroy the already disrupted environment. </div><div>4. <strong>Clearance exemption: </strong>If the clearance exemption clause is still provided, communities that will be affected by coal mining, petrochemical plants, irrigation or waterway projects will no longer be able to report industrial violations. In turn, again destroying the environment, forests and wildlife. </div><div>5. <strong>Fines in place of criminal implications: </strong>Small fines in place of criminal implications will give a leeway for industries to continue with their violations and destruction of the environment and its resources by just paying a small fine. </div><div>6. <strong>No public participation for dams, mining and highway expansion: </strong>Such projects no doubt are essential for development but if the communities residing around them, or the forest and the wilife surrounding the projects are being affected at alarming rates, there will not be any grievance redressal. It takes away the rights of vulnerable communities. If forests and wildlife are being affected by them, there will be no grievance redressal.</div><div>In conclusion, all these new norms give free and easy access to industries to damage our already affected environment, threatened forests and wildlife and takes away the rights of the vulnerable communities, forests or wildlife affected by them. In the wake of this pandemic, we should be more thoughtful and considerate about our environment .</div><div><br /><strong>Suggestions:</strong></div><div>- Rather than compromising on the time needed for gathering public opinion, the government should focus on bringing down the average delay of 238 days in granting environmental clearance. In Kerala, the administration took 1,049 days to clear the construction of the IT park project of M/s T Tech Park Ltd, instead of 105 days.</div><div>- Either extend the public hearing time for EIA2020 or please scrap the current norms that are very detrimental for the environment as well as communities and their livelihoods.</div>';">
