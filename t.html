Baghjan PML, owned by OIL India Ltd. and operated by John Energy Pvt. Ltd., experienced a blowout on 27th May 2020 which was followed by a massive fire explosion on 9th June 2020 – all the while oil from the well continued to leak. 
This disaster has opened our eyes to a history of exploitative and illegal practices adopted by OIL India Ltd. with the irrevocable support of MoEFCC.

There has undeniably been a huge loss of biodiversity, livelihoods, and oil reserves.  
Biodiversity: Report (as per status of leak from 28th May 2020 to 2nd June 2020) by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) states that “The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments, which will not only affect current life conditions, but due to sustained release over a long period, pose a serious health risk for a longer term” 
Livelihoods: While 50 houses have been burnt, several households are flooded with water mixed with oil condensate. Farms have been rendered useless for years to come and current cropland and livestock has been damaged. 
Oil reserves: As per company report, cumulative production loss since May 27 due to bandhs and blockades has been 5386 MT of crude oil and 7.04 MMSCM of natural gas.

The foremost question to be asked is: Could this disaster be prevented, and if a disaster is an unfortunate possibility then, could the impact of this disaster have been reduced?

A disaster of this scale is attributed to not merely negligence of oil well operators on one day but to a history of negligence displayed by OIL India Ltd., MoEFCC and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. Unless authorities from the aforementioned organisations accept their complicity to the disaster, more such disasters will happen in the future.

In an attempt to answer the question – whether the impact of the disaster could be reduced – we bring the following points to light: 

Oil and Natural gas exploration is an extremely complex practice. 
Several studies show that mishandling of such a plant could lead to the devastation of not only the local environment but also affect the global environmental conditions.
Given the risky nature of exploration and mining projects, the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) is expected to have a strict approach towards them, while the companies handling such projects are expected to have a sensitive approach towards the local communities and biodiversity.

India currently faces a huge lack of expertise to deal with oil spills and related incidents.
It is observed that India’s efforts to explore oil, mine coal etc. are placed in the best interest of the economy but such projects are not equipped with adequate facilities to deal with on-site accidents – as has been observed from previous oil spills in the country (major ones including Chennai(2016) and Sunderbans(2014)). The response work after the Baghjan incident appeared to be as inefficient as response work after the previous incidents. The disasters in the past decade had brought the need for a proper dissemination and management system to light, but compliance with these vital rules remains extremel
