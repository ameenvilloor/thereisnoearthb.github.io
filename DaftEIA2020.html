More like Daft EIA 2020&body=<p>Hi there,</p>t<p>I am a concerned and worried school student of India, and this is my vote for Draft EIA 2020 - NO! Withdraw Draft EIA 2020.</p><p>And kindly, don not revolve your thoughts around my age, because being a child living in lethal pollution, I have very well learnt what could be the other much severe impacts of Climate Change. Our world is on the brink of a breakdown, and yet, we are insisting upon continuing with such activities which harm our already fragile Ecosystem. </p><p>While we follow the footsteps of other Industrialized Nations, we are forgetting that it is because of the way those countries developed, we are in this Climate Crisis and that is why we must not follow what they did because what they did were HUGE MISTAKES! Rather, India should become an inspiration for the whole world by choosing a path of Green Economy, because that is the only way forward. And IT I S NOT AT ALL IMPOSSIBLE FOR INDIA.</p><p>If Edward the First of England, could ban the burning of coal in the medieval era, WHY CANNOT WE?</p><p>If startups in India itself are encouraging green jobs then the government shall support them and create much much more such jobs for the rest of the nation, AND WHY SHOULDN WE NOT?</p><p>If the concept of Eco-Tourism exists, then the government must bring it to the limelight AND WHY SHOULDN YOU NOT?</p><p>The only ending remarks I want to give in is that there are many ways, but only if the government accepts them. We do not need to put an already-fragile Nature onto the deathbed because that is the worst thing that a developed Civilization could do. Let us respect nature and its entities which are on the verge of existence and bring into action an Economic Plan which could make India both Economically and Ecologically strategic and inspiring.</p><p>And yes! this mail was purely written by me and not my Parents, Grandparents or some relative. </p><p>Regards</p>';">
