This proposal involves the cutting of 12,097 trees and the diversion of 31.015 ha of protected forest area (24.265 in the National Park and 6.75 in the WLS). About 3.15 km of the transmission line is proposed to be constructed through the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary. As per the application, the line would be 46 meters in width, requiring a diversion of 11. 54 HA of the area from the wildlife sanctuary and involves the cutting of 12,097 trees. </p>';">
